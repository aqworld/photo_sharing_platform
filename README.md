  ### **Outline of a website where you can upload photos**

  Not fully functional, you are unable to view and share photos 

  You can upload photos, and the website has a basic account system, and that's pretty much it.
  The entire website is using php.

  If you want to copy the reposetory, just replace the htdocs of a php project, with this. 
  Make sure to set up phpmyadmin with a username and password, and the website should work properly. Site should be secure.
